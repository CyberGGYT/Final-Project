        <h1>Cheating & Scandals</h1>
        <p>
            Competitive Geometry Dash operates on trust. When cheating occurs, it damages not only
            leaderboards, but the credibility of the entire community.

            <h3>Botting</h3>
            <p>
                Bots replicate recorded inputs with inhuman precision, allowing levels to be completed
                without real-time execution.
            </p>
            <p>
                Modern bots intentionally add imperfections to mimic human inconsistency.

            <h3>Speedhack</h3>
            <p>
                Speedhacks manipulate the game clock, letting players practice or complete levels
                in slowed time while presenting normal-speed footage.
            </p>
            <p>
                This method is often paired with edited recordings.

            <h3>Macroing</h3>
            <p>
                Macros automate specific input patterns, commonly used in wave and ship sections
                that require extreme consistency.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even partial macro usage is considered cheating.

            <h2>Major Scandal: SpaceUK</h2>
            <p>
                Once considered the greatest Geometry Dash player, <strong>SpaceUK</strong> was exposed
                for falsifying dozens of Extreme Demon completions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over multiple years, advanced NoClip and speed manipulation tools were used to fabricate
                legitimate-looking runs.

                <h4>Input Irregularities</h4>
                <p>
                    Click intervals showed mathematically impossible consistency across entire runs.

        <h2>Community Countermeasures</h2>

        <p>
            Following major scandals, the community introduced stricter verification standards
            to preserve competitive integrity.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Mandatory full-session recordings</li>
            <li>Frame-by-frame analysis</li>
            <li>Audio and input rhythm validation</li>
            <li>Third-party verification teams</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
        <p>
            Every legitimate completion represents thousands of attempts and genuine mastery.
            Cheating undermines that effort and erodes trust.
        </p>
        <p>
            Integrity ensures Geometry Dash remains a test of skill — not software.
