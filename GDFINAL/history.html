            <h1>The Birth of Geometry Dash</h1>
            <p>
                <strong>Geometry Dash</strong> was released in August 2013 by independent developer Robert Topala, known online as RobTop. Originally titled <strong>Geometry Jump</strong>, the game launched on mobile devices with only seven official levels and a minimalist visual style.
            </p>
            <p>
                The core mechanic was deceptively simple: a single input controlled all movement, forcing players to synchronize perfectly with fast-paced electronic music. This rhythmic feedback loop, paired with instant failure, created an addictive experience that spread rapidly through word of mouth.

            <h1>Early Expansion and Identity</h1>
            <p>
                Early updates rapidly expanded Geometry Dash’s mechanical identity. <strong>Version 1.2</strong> introduced the Ball gamemode and speed portals, allowing creators to alter pacing and gravity in ways that dramatically increased design complexity.
            </p>
            <p>
                The pivotal moment arrived with <strong>Version 1.4</strong>, which added the User Coin system. Coins transformed Geometry Dash from a casual arcade game into a mastery-focused platformer, encouraging players to fully complete levels rather than merely survive them.

            <h1>The PC Transition</h1>
            <p>
                Geometry Dash launched on <strong>Steam in late 2014</strong>, marking a major shift in the game’s competitive trajectory. While mobile remained popular, PC offered superior performance, reduced input latency, and higher refresh rates.
            </p>
            <p>
                This transition laid the groundwork for the modern competitive scene. Players began pushing extreme precision, discovering that higher frame rates made certain inputs more consistent, even if not officially intended by the engine.
            </p>

                <p>PC play enabled frame-perfect execution and the rise of ultra-difficult levels.</p>

        <div class="history-content section">
            <h1>The Difficulty Explosion</h1>
            <p>
                <strong>Version 1.9</strong> fundamentally altered Geometry Dash with the introduction of the <strong>Wave gamemode</strong> and the Dual mechanic. The Wave required continuous diagonal control, demanding unprecedented precision and consistency.
            </p>
            <p>
                These mechanics enabled levels like <strong>Bloodbath</strong>, which effectively established the Extreme Demon category and reshaped community perceptions of what was humanly possible.
            </p>

            <img src="wave.jpg" class="image-holder">

            <p>
                Difficulty ceilings rose dramatically, and the game’s culture began shifting toward endurance, muscle memory, and long-term grinding rather than short-term reaction.

            <h1>The Creative Renaissance</h1>
            <p>
                <strong>Versions 2.0 and 2.1</strong> expanded the editor into a cinematic toolset. Movement triggers, camera controls, rotation systems, and alpha blending enabled creators to design levels that resembled animated short films.
            </p>
            <p>
                This era gave rise to art levels, mega-collaborations, and highly experimental gameplay. When the wait for <strong>Version 2.2</strong> stretched across multiple years, creators continued to innovate, pushing 2.1 to its absolute limits.
