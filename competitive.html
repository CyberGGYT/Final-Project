        <h1>The Competitive Geometry Dash Scene</h1>
        <p>
            Competitive <strong>Geometry Dash</strong> represents the absolute peak of precision-based gaming. Unlike traditional esports,
            the scene is entirely community-driven, built on trust, verification, and technical mastery rather than official tournaments.
        </p>
        <p>
            Players compete not against opponents in real time, but against the game itself — pushing human limits through extreme
            difficulty, endurance, and consistency.

        <h2>The Demon List System</h2>
        <p>
            Since the game officially categorizes difficulty only up to <strong>Extreme Demon</strong>, the community created the
            <strong>Demon List</strong> to rank the hardest levels ever verified.
        </p>

        <div class="side-inline">
            <h4>How the Demon List Works</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Only the hardest Extreme Demons are ranked</li>
                <li>Difficulty is evaluated by experienced list moderators</li>
                <li>Players earn ranking points by completing listed levels</li>
                <li>Higher-ranked levels give more competitive value</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>
            Verification requires full video proof, accurate attempt counts, and complete transparency. Any inconsistency can result
            in a completion being rejected.
        </p>

            <div class="stat-card">
                <h3>Attempt Counts</h3>
                <p>
                    Top Extreme Demons regularly exceed <strong>100,000+</strong> attempts, with some verifications taking years to complete.
                </p>

            <div class="stat-card">
                <h3>FPS Standards</h3>
                <p>
                    Competitive players commonly use <strong>240–360 FPS</strong> to enable consistent frame-perfect inputs.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="stat-card">
                <h3>Verification Rules</h3>
                <p>
                    Facecam or handcam footage is often required for top-level list placements.

                <h3>Completion Proof</h3>
                <p>
                    Videos must show the entire run with no cuts, speed changes, or visual anomalies.

        <h2>The Grind & Competitive Pressure</h2>
        <p>
            Competitive Geometry Dash demands extraordinary mental endurance. Players repeat the same sequences thousands of times,
            developing muscle memory through sheer repetition.
        </p>
        <p>
            Community scrutiny is intense, as every high-level completion is analyzed frame by frame. This pressure ensures
            authenticity, but also highlights the dedication required to succeed at the top.
